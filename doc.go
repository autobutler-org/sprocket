// Package sprocket probes, thumbnails, trims, and remuxes video files.
//
// Probe reports duration, dimensions, codecs, bitrate, framerate, and rotation.
// Thumbnail decodes the keyframe nearest a requested time to an image.Image.
// Trim cuts a range at keyframe boundaries by copying streams. Remux moves the
// same streams into a different container. Trim and Remux never re-encode.
//
// Guarantees:
//
//   - No cgo and no external binaries. Decoder backends may be compiled to
//     WASM and run under wazero, which keeps those properties.
//   - Bounded memory. Inputs are read through an io.ReaderAt or io.ReadSeeker
//     and payload moves with io.Copy over byte ranges, so a multi-gigabyte file
//     costs megabytes of heap. Anything read whole is capped by a limit the
//     library chooses, never by a size the file declares.
//   - Cross-compiles to linux/arm64, darwin/arm64, and the host.
//
// Non-goals: re-encoding, scaling, filters, and quality reduction of any kind;
// exact-timestamp frame extraction, since thumbnails snap to keyframes;
// streaming protocols.
//
// Nothing is implemented yet. See https://github.com/autobutler-org/sprocket/issues/13.
